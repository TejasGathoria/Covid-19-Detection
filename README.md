# Covid-19-Detection
Welcome to the Chest X-Ray Classification Web App repository! This project encompasses a ResNet-18 based image classification model trained to categorize chest X-ray scans into Normal, Pneumonia, and COVID-19 classes. Seamlessly integrated into a user-friendly Flask web application, this tool empowers users to upload X-ray images for instant classification. Achieving an impressive accuracy of 96.6% and a precision of 90% on the COVID19 Radiography dataset, this project holds promise in aiding medical diagnosis through efficient and accurate image analysis.
